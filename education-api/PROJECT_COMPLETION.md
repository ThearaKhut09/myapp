- **Required Field Validation**
- **Detailed Error Messages** for validation failures

### ✅ Mock Data Implementation
- **Database-Independent Operation** using mock data
- **Realistic Sample Data** for all entities
- **Relationship Simulation** with nested data structures
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage** across all endpoints

### ✅ Testing & Documentation

- **Health Check Endpoints** (`/api/status`, `/api/test`)
- **Validation Testing** with invalid data scenarios
- **Complete API Documentation** with examples and usage

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Framework & Dependencies
- **Laravel 11** - Modern PHP framework
- **PHP 8.2+** - Latest PHP features
- **Apache/XAMPP** - Local development server
- **cURL** - HTTP client for testing

### API Design Patterns
- **RESTful Endpoints** following REST conventions
- **Resource-based URLs** (`/api/resource/{id}`)
- **HTTP Status Codes** (200, 201, 404, 422, 500)
- **JSON Request/Response** format
- **Pagination Support** with metadata

### Data Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: Institution → Courses, Institution → Instructors
- **One-to-Many**: Instructor → Courses, Student → Enrollments
- **Many-to-Many**: Student ↔ Course (via Enrollments)
